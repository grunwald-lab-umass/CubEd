Mirror Alignment Mirrors can be used to direct the beam. The CubeEd mirrors are orientated within the cube allow a 90° redirection, give or take with adjustments; i.e. the mirror cubes enable the beam to travel around corners.

Horizontal mirrors can be used to direct the beam path 90° left or right.

Vertical mirrors can be used to direct the beam path 90° up or down.

1.  Adjust the mirror angle with the set screws to keep the beam path on the same plane.

**Tip:** Use the same paper method as that used in [step 3](CM_Beam_Collim.qmd "To determine whether the beam is centered, place a cube on the other side of the paper with light behind it to act as a target for centering the beam path.") of [Beam Collimation](CM_Beam_Collim.qmd) to ensure that the beam path stays straight.
