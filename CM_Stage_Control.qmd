| **Joystick** | Controls the movement of the stage. Does not contribute to speed control. Push the joystick all the way in one direction at a time to move the stage. Movement of the x- and y-axes are controlled in one mode, the z-axis is controlled in a second mode. |
| **Start** | Switches between the two joystick modes: x/y and z (z-mode only uses the vertical axis of the joystick). Hold for one second to toggle mode. |
| **Select** | Moves the stage to the “home” position. Hold for one second to reset the stage position. |
