## Laser Hazard

![](images/laser_safety.png){fig-alt="Caution: Class 3R Laser" fig-align="center"}

A Class 3R laser is low powered, which normally does not harm eyes during momentary exposure. This duration is within the aversion response, when a person turns away and/or blinks to avoid bright light.

**Do not deliberately look or stare into the laser beam.** Laser protective eye wear is normally unnecessary. A Class 3R laser is neither a skin nor materials burn hazard.

However, a Class 3R laser can be a distraction, glare or flash blindness hazard for pilots and drivers. **NEVER aim any laser towards an aircraft or a vehicle in motion.** This is unsafe and is illegal â€“ you could be arrested and jailed.

**ONLY ALLOW USE BY RESPONSIBLE PERSONS!!!**

This is NOT a toy. Continuous adult supervision is required for children to safely use Class 3R lasers.

Please refer to the documentation provided by the manufacturer for additional warnings and preventive, protective equipment (PPE) requirements (e.g. laser safety goggles).

Always consult your local Laser Safety Officer or Radiation Safety Officer and refer to your laboratory safety documentation for more information.

You can also consult the [Laser Safety Standards ANSI Z136](https://blog.ansi.org/ansi-z136-1-2022-safe-use-of-lasers/){target="_blank"} in North America, [SUVA 66049.D](https://www.suva.ch/en/download/documents/be-careful-with-lasers--handling-laser-equipment-safely/standard-variante--66049.E){target="_blank"} in Europe, and [BS EN 60825-1](https://knowledge.bsigroup.com/products/safety-of-laser-products-equipment-classification-and-requirements-1?version=standard){target="_blank"} in the UK. Additionally, laser safety standards and regulations are covered by IEC norm 60825-1, and LED eye safety standards and regulations are covered by IEC norm 62471 in Europe.

**Safety guideline:** Hazardous, visible, or invisible radiation from lasers, lamps, and other light sources used for microscopy can cause permanent damage to the retina, skin burns, and fire. Always follow proper laser safety protocols for your equipment and situation.

### Additional Reminders

-   Never touch any lenses or mirrors directly with your hands or fingers.
-   Never put any part of your body in the beam path, it is dangerous.
